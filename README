Goals:

a simple tetris game with:

- fixed resolution

- OpenGL graphics/SDL input and windowing

- keyboard input

- text rendering with SDL_ttf

- scoring

- preview of next block in side menu

Notes:

Collision of blocks will be done with a map of block locations in an array, everytime the block about to be placed moves down, the new location will be checked first.

In order to confirm to the Tetris guidelines, resolution is 480x480 with the side menu filling the right portion of the screen and the game filling the left

the grid is 10x22 with 2 of the 22 hidden at the top

each block is therefore 24x24

TODO:

Rotation
row clearance
Side menu
